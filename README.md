# 🗃️ Structured Data Management Project

This project was part of a graduate-level coursework assignment focused on applying principles of **structured data handling**, **schema design**, and **basic analytics** using a real-world environmental dataset. The dataset involved weather conditions and aimed to simulate how structured datasets are ingested, stored, and analyzed in enterprise systems.

## 📊 Project Overview

- **Domain:** Weather Monitoring / Environmental Data  
- **Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, PostgreSQL, ER Modeling, CSV  
- **Key Focus:** Schema creation, data validation, EDA, and analytics pipeline

## 🔍 Key Features

- ✅ Cleaned and validated real-world weather data (temperature, humidity, timestamp, etc.)  
- ✅ Designed a normalized PostgreSQL schema capturing relationships between weather stations, readings, and conditions  
- ✅ Created an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for clear schema communication  
- ✅ Performed exploratory data analysis using Pandas and Matplotlib  
- ✅ Visualized key metrics like daily temperatures, humidity distribution, and station-wise summaries
